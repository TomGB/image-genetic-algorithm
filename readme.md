## Evolving images using js canvas and trianges.

- The genetic algorithm uses a genome to define the position and colour of the triangles.
- The fitness function compares each individual's generated image with the target image.
- The fittest percentage of the population survive and breed to create a new population.
- Mutations are introduced to the genome in the form of new triangles.
